# Requirement_1
* The first code is for 1a
* The second code is for 1b

# Requirement_2
* The first code is for generating a tool which scan for all the image from google image in the given link. But the downside of it is google image can load only a few images (not even close to 1000)
* The second code is using Pexels API to downloading 1000 true images from the web. It can download successfully 1000 true images
* The third code is using Replicate API to send request to the webside for erlich, which is the text2image latent diffusion model from CompVis, to generate images with the content in "promt". This code has a downside which is the free request is limited.
